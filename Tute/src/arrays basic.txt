Arrays (non-primitive)-  everything should be of same data type , homogenous , contigous 

int arr[] = new int[10]; - new creates memory in the healp memory 

to search for elemnt at cetainposition - (x+4)*index

enhanced loop - for each 

copying of the loop -  we can copy the loomlike

int other = arr[]

so now if we change the other[1] , it will also reflect it in the main arr array as it having same address 

chnages in heap memory persists 

memory allocation is dynamic 
objects are stored in heap 
the arrays in java are not continouss

int defaut - 0
ch default - space
string default - null

we change arrays to strings and print it in the form of strings using Arrays.toString(arr) method
